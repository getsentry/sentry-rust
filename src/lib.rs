//!
//! This crate provides support for logging events and errors / panics to
//! the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) error logging service.  It integrates with
//! the standard panic system in Rust as well as a few popular error handling
//! setups.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! To use the crate you need to create a client first.  When a client is created
//! it's typically bound to the current thread by calling `bind_client`.  By default
//! this happens by using the `sentry::init` convenience function.  When the client
//! is bound to the main thread it also becomes the default client for future
//! threads created but it is always possible to override the client for a thread
//! later by explicitly binding it.
//!
//! The `sentry::init` function returns a guard that when dropped will flush
//! Events that were not yet sent to the sentry service.  It has a two second
//! deadline for this so shutdown of applications might slightly delay as a result
//! of this.
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate sentry;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let _guard = sentry::init("https://key@sentry.io/42");
//!     sentry::capture_message("Hello World!", sentry::Level::Info);
//!     // when the guard goes out of scope here, the client will wait up to two
//!     // seconds to send remaining events to the service.
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Integrations
//!
//! What makes this crate useful are the various integrations that exist.  Some
//! of them are enabled by default, some uncommon ones or for deprecated parts of
//! the ecosystem a feature flag needs to be enabled.  For the available
//! integrations and how to use them see [integrations](integrations/index.html).
//!
//! # Scope Management
//!
//! Data is typically bound to a scope.  A new scope can be introduced by pushing it
//! with the [`push_scope`](fn.push_scope.html) function.  That scope can then be
//! configured with [`configure_scope`](fn.configure_scope.html) which lets you
//! attach data to it that will be sent along with errors.
//!
//! If a new scope is pushed the data and currently bound client are inherited.  To
//! propagate that scope to a completely different thread a
//! [`scope_handle`](fn.scope_handle.html) can be acquired and passed to a thread
//! where it can be bound.
//!
//! # Shim Only API
//!
//! This crate can also be used in "shim only" mode.  This is enabled by disabling all
//! default features of the crate.  In that mode a minimal API set is retained that
//! can be used to instrument code for Sentry without actually using Sentry.  The
//! shim is a small set of APIs that dispatch to the underlying implementations on
//! the configured Sentry client.  If the client is not there the shim will blackhole
//! a lot of operations.
//!
//! Only if a user then also uses and configures Sentry this code becomes used.
//!
//! In shim mode some types are restricted in functionality.  For instance the `Client` in shim
//! mode does not retain all API functionality.  To see what the APIs in shim-only
//! mode look like refer to [the shim only docs](shim/index.html).
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Functionality of the crate can be turned on and off by feature flags.  This is the
//! current list of feature flags:
//!
//! default flags:
//!
//! * `with_client_implementation`: turns on the real client implementation.
//! * `with_backtrace`: enables backtrace support (automatically turned on in a few cases)
//! * `with_panic`: enables the panic integration
//! * `with_failure`: enables the `failure` integration
//! * `with_log`: enables the `log` integration
//! * `with_device_info`: enables the device info context
//! * `with_rust_info`: enables the rust compiler info context
//! * `with_debug_meta`: enables debug meta support (permits server side symbolication)
//!
//! additional features:
//!
//! * `with_error_chain`: enables the error-chain integration
//! * `with_shim_api`: compiles the shim only api into a dummy `shim` module for inspection.
//!   This API cannot be used but it can be inspected for documentation purposes.
