//!
//! This crate provides support for logging events and errors / panics to
//! the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) error logging service.  It integrates with
//! the standard panic system in Rust as well as a few popular error handling
//! setups.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! To use the crate you need to create a client first.  When a client is created
//! it's typically bound to the current thread by calling `bind_client`.  By default
//! this happens by using the `sentry::init` convenience function.  When the client
//! is bound to the main thread it also becomes the default client for future
//! threads created but it is always possible to override the client for a thread
//! later by explicitly binding it.
//!
//! The `sentry::init` function returns a guard that when dropped will flush
//! Events that were not yet sent to the sentry service.  It has a two second
//! deadline for this so shutdown of applications might slightly delay as a result
//! of this.  Keep the guard around or sending events will not work.
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate sentry;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let _guard = sentry::init("https://key@sentry.io/42");
//!     sentry::capture_message("Hello World!", sentry::Level::Info);
//!     // when the guard goes out of scope here, the client will wait up to two
//!     // seconds to send remaining events to the service.
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Integrations
//!
//! What makes this crate useful are the various integrations that exist.  Some
//! of them are enabled by default, some uncommon ones or for deprecated parts of
//! the ecosystem a feature flag needs to be enabled.  For the available
//! integrations and how to use them see [integrations](integrations/index.html).
//!
//! # Scopes, Threads and Hubs
//!
//! Data is typically bound to a [`Scope`](struct.Scope.html).  Scopes are stored
//! in a hidden stack on a [`Hub`](struct.Hub.html).  Once the library has been
//! initialized a hub is automatically available.  In the default config a new
//! hub is created for each thread and they act independently.
//!
//! The thread that calls `sentry::init` initializes the first hub which then automatically
//! becomes the base of new hubs (You can get that hub by calling `Hub::main()`).  If a
//! new thread is spawned it gets a new hub based on that one (the thread calls
//! `Hub::new_from_top(Hub::main())`).  The current thread's hub is returned from
//! `Hub::current()`.  Any hub that is wrapped in an `Arc` can be temporarily bound to a
//! thread with `Hub::run`.  For more information see [`Hub`](struct.Hub.html).
//!
//! Users are expected to reconfigure the scope with
//! [`configure_scope`](fn.configure_scope.html).  For more elaborate scope management
//! the hub needs to be interfaced with directly.
//!
//! In some situations (particularly in async code) it's often not possible to use
//! the thread local hub.  In that case a hub can be explicitly created and passed
//! around.  However due to the nature of some integrations some functionality like
//! automatic breadcrumb recording depends on the thread local hub being correctly
//! configured.
//!
//! # Minimal API
//!
//! This crate can also be used in "minimal" mode.  This is enabled by disabling all
//! default features of the crate.  In that mode a minimal API set is retained that
//! can be used to instrument code for Sentry without actually using Sentry.  The
//! minimal API is a small set of APIs that dispatch to the underlying implementations on
//! the configured Sentry client.  If the client is not there the minimal API will blackhole
//! a lot of operations.
//!
//! Only if a user then also uses and configures Sentry this code becomes used.
//!
//! In minimal mode some types are restricted in functionality.  For instance the
//! `Client` is not available and the `Hub` does not retain all API functionality.
//! To see what the APIs in mnimal mode look like you can build the docs for this
//! crate without any features enabled.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Functionality of the crate can be turned on and off by feature flags.  This is the
//! current list of feature flags:
//!
//! default flags:
//!
//! * `with_client_implementation`: turns on the real client implementation.
//! * `with_backtrace`: enables backtrace support (automatically turned on in a few cases)
//! * `with_panic`: enables the panic integration
//! * `with_failure`: enables the `failure` integration
//! * `with_log`: enables the `log` integration
//! * `with_env_logger`: enables the `env_logger` integration
//! * `with_device_info`: enables the device info context
//! * `with_rust_info`: enables the rust compiler info context
//! * `with_debug_meta`: enables debug meta support (permits server side symbolication)
//!
//! additional features:
//!
//! * `with_error_chain`: enables the error-chain integration
//! * `with_test_support`: enables the test support module
