# Sentry Rust SDK: sentry-core

This crate provides the core of the [Sentry] SDK, which can be used to log
events and errors.

`sentry-core` is meant for integration authors and third-party library authors
that want to instrument their code for sentry.

Regular users who wish to integrate sentry into their applications should
instead use the [`sentry`] crate, which comes with a default transport and
a large set of integrations for various third-party libraries.

## Core Concepts

This crate follows the [Unified API] guidelines and is centered around
the concepts of [`Client`], [`Hub`] and [`Scope`], as well as the extension
points via the [`Integration`], [`Transport`] and [`TransportFactory`] traits.

## Parallelism, Concurrency and Async

The main concurrency primitive is the [`Hub`]. In general, all concurrent
code, no matter if multithreaded parallelism or futures concurrency, needs
to run with its own copy of a [`Hub`]. Even though the [`Hub`] is internally
synchronized, using it concurrently may lead to unexpected results up to
panics.

For threads or tasks that are running concurrently or outlive the current
execution context, a new [`Hub`] needs to be created and bound for the computation.

```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;
use sentry::{Hub, SentryFutureExt};
use std::sync::Arc;

// Parallel multithreaded code:
let outer_hub = Hub::current();
let results: Vec<_> = [1_u32, 2, 3]
    .into_par_iter()
    .map(|num| {
        let thread_hub = Arc::new(Hub::new_from_top(&outer_hub));
        Hub::run(thread_hub, || num * num)
    })
    .collect();

assert_eq!(&results, &[1, 4, 9]);

// Concurrent futures code:
let futures = [1_u32, 2, 3]
    .into_iter()
    .map(|num| async move { num * num }.bind_hub(Hub::new_from_top(Hub::current())));
let results = futures::future::join_all(futures).await;

assert_eq!(&results, &[1, 4, 9]);
```

For tasks that are not concurrent and do not outlive the current execution
context, no *new* [`Hub`] needs to be created, but the current [`Hub`] has
to be bound.

```rust
use sentry::{Hub, SentryFutureExt};

// Spawned thread that is being joined:
let hub = Hub::current();
let result = std::thread::spawn(|| Hub::run(hub, || 1_u32)).join();

assert_eq!(result.unwrap(), 1);

// Spawned future that is being awaited:
let result = tokio::spawn(async { 1_u32 }.bind_hub(Hub::current())).await;

assert_eq!(result.unwrap(), 1);
```

## Minimal API

By default, this crate comes with a so-called "minimal" mode. This mode will
provide all the APIs needed to instrument code with sentry, and to write
sentry integrations, but it will blackhole a lot of operations.

In minimal mode some types are restricted in functionality. For instance
the [`Client`] is not available and the [`Hub`] does not retain all API
functionality.

## Features

- `feature = "client"`: Activates the [`Client`] type and certain
  [`Hub`] functionality.
- `feature = "test"`: Activates the [`test`] module, which can be used to
  write integration tests. It comes with a test transport which can capture
  all sent events for inspection.
- `feature = "debug-logs"`: Uses the `log` crate for debug output, instead
  of printing to `stderr`. This feature is **deprecated** and will be
  replaced by a dedicated log callback in the future.
