/// The most common implementations that can be passed:
///
/// * `Breadcrumb`: to record a breadcrumb
/// * `Vec<Breadcrumb>`: to record more than one breadcrumb in one go.
/// * `Option<Breadcrumb>`: to record a breadcrumb or not
/// * additionally all of these can also be returned from an `FnOnce()`
