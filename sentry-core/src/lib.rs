//!
//! This crate provides the core of the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) SDK, which
//! can be used to log events and errors.
//!
//! This crate is meant for integration authors and third party library authors
//! that want to instrument their code for sentry.
//!
//! Regular users who wish to integrate sentry into their applications should
//! rather use the [`sentry`] crate, which comes with a default transport, and
//! a large set of integrations for various third-party libraries.
//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! This crate follows the [Unified API] guidelines and is centered around
//! the concepts of [`Client`], [`Hub`] and [`Scope`], as well as the extension
//! points via the [`Integration`], [`Transport`] and [`TransportFactory`] traits.
//!
//! # Minimal API
//!
//! By default, this crate comes with a so-called "minimal" mode. This mode will
//! provide all the APIs needed to instrument code with sentry, and to write
//! sentry integrations, but it will blackhole a lot of operations.
//!
//! In minimal mode some types are restricted in functionality. For instance
//! the [`Client`] is not available and the [`Hub`] does not retain all API
//! functionality.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * `feature = "client"`: Activates the [`Client`] type and certain
//!   [`Hub`] functionality.
//! * `feature = "test"`: Activates the [`test`] module, which can be used to
//!   write integration tests. It comes with a test transport which can capture
//!   all sent events for inspection.
//! * `feature = "debug-logs"`: Uses the `log` crate for debug output, instead
//!   of printing to `stderr`. This feature is **deprecated** and will be
//!   replaced by a dedicated log callback in the future.
