# Sentry Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/getsentry/sentry-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/getsentry/sentry-rust)
[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/sentry.svg?style=flat)](https://crates.io/crates/sentry)

This is a new work in progress Sentry library. It will eventually be published to
crates.io as `sentry`. At the moment the crate on creates.io is an older and
incompatible version of this crate.

## Requirements

We currently only verify this crate against a recent version fo Sentry hosted on
[sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) but it should work with on-prem Sentry versions
8.20 and later.

Additionally, the lowest Rust version we target is _1.22.0_.
