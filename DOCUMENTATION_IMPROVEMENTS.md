# Documentation Improvements for sentry-rust

This document summarizes the documentation improvements made to address [issue #149](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/149) regarding insufficient documentation for crates.io.

## Overview

The goal was to review and improve the documentation that gets exported to crates.io, ensuring that public APIs have sufficient documentation to help users understand their purpose, usage, and behavior.

## Improved Documentation

### Core Sentry Components

#### 1. `Scope` Methods (sentry-core/src/scope/real.rs)

**Improved methods:**
- `set_level()` - Added explanation of severity levels and override behavior
- `set_fingerprint()` - Detailed explanation of event grouping control with examples
- `set_transaction()` - Clear description of performance monitoring usage
- `set_user()` - Comprehensive user context documentation with examples
- `set_tag()` - Explained tags vs other data types, with best practices
- `set_context()` - Detailed structured context documentation with examples  
- `set_extra()` - Clear distinction from tags, JSON-serializable nature

#### 2. `Hub` Methods (sentry-core/src/hub.rs)

**Improved methods:**
- `last_event_id()` - Added use cases and return value clarification
- `push_scope()` - Detailed scope inheritance and usage examples

#### 3. `Client` Methods (sentry-core/src/client.rs)

**Improved methods:**
- `prepare_event()` - Explained complete event pipeline processing
- `capture_event()` - Comprehensive event capture documentation with examples
- `flush()` - Clarified difference from `close()` and usage scenarios
- `close()` - Explained permanent shutdown behavior vs `flush()`

#### 4. Performance Monitoring (sentry-core/src/performance.rs)

**Improved methods:**
- `Transaction::set_data()` - Clear explanation with examples
- `Transaction::set_status()` - Status types and performance monitoring context
- `Transaction::iter_headers()` - Distributed tracing header documentation
- `Span::set_data()` - Consistent with transaction documentation

### Integration Crates

#### 5. Log Integration (sentry-log/src/logger.rs)

**Improved `SentryLogger`:**
- Comprehensive struct documentation explaining dual forwarding
- Default behavior explanation (ERROR → events, WARN/INFO → breadcrumbs)
- Multiple usage examples: basic setup, custom filtering, custom mapping
- Integration patterns with existing loggers

### Main Sentry Crate

#### 6. Initialization (sentry/src/init.rs)

**Improved `init()` function:**
- Detailed explanation as primary initialization method
- Comprehensive configuration type support
- Environment variable documentation
- Multiple examples covering common use cases:
  - Basic DSN setup
  - Advanced configuration
  - Disabled mode for development
  - Custom integrations
  - Long-running applications
- Clear guard behavior explanation

## Documentation Patterns Applied

### Consistent Structure
- **Purpose**: What the function/method does
- **Behavior**: How it works and when to use it
- **Parameters**: What inputs are expected
- **Return Values**: What is returned and what it means
- **Examples**: Practical usage scenarios
- **Related Methods**: Cross-references where helpful

### Examples Focus
- Provided practical, copy-pasteable examples
- Covered common use cases and patterns
- Showed both basic and advanced usage
- Included explanatory comments

### Cross-References
- Linked to related functions and types
- Referenced official Sentry documentation where relevant
- Maintained consistency with existing documentation style

### Best Practices
- Explained when to use vs when not to use certain features
- Provided guidance on performance implications
- Included security considerations where relevant
- Clarified differences between similar methods

## Impact

These improvements significantly enhance the developer experience by:

1. **Reducing Onboarding Friction**: New users can understand APIs without external documentation
2. **Improving Discoverability**: Clear documentation helps users find the right methods for their needs
3. **Preventing Misuse**: Examples and explanations help avoid common pitfalls
4. **Enhanced IDE Experience**: Better auto-complete and hover documentation
5. **Consistency**: Unified documentation style across the entire crate ecosystem

## Files Modified

- `sentry-core/src/scope/real.rs` - Core scope manipulation methods
- `sentry-core/src/hub.rs` - Hub management functions
- `sentry-core/src/client.rs` - Client lifecycle and event processing
- `sentry-core/src/performance.rs` - Performance monitoring APIs
- `sentry-log/src/logger.rs` - Log integration setup
- `sentry/src/init.rs` - Primary initialization function

All improvements maintain backward compatibility and follow Rust documentation conventions using standard rustdoc formatting.
