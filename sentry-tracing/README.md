# Sentry Rust SDK: sentry-tracing

Support for automatic breadcrumb, event, and trace capturing from `tracing` events.

The `tracing` crate is supported in three ways. First, events can be captured as breadcrumbs for
later. Secondly, error events can be captured as events to Sentry. Finally, spans can be
recorded as structured transaction events. By default, events above `Info` are recorded as
breadcrumbs, events above `Error` are captured as error events, and spans above `Info` are
recorded as transactions.

## Configuration

To fully enable the tracing integration, set the traces sample rate and add a layer to the
tracing subscriber:

```rust
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

let _guard = sentry::init(sentry::ClientOptions {
    // Enable capturing of traces; set this a to lower value in production:
    traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
    ..sentry::ClientOptions::default()
});

// Register the Sentry tracing layer to capture breadcrumbs, events, and spans:
tracing_subscriber::registry()
    .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
    .with(sentry_tracing::layer())
    .init();
```

It is also possible to set an explicit filter, to customize which log events are captured by
Sentry:

```rust
use sentry_tracing::EventFilter;
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

let sentry_layer = sentry_tracing::layer().event_filter(|md| match md.level() {
    &tracing::Level::ERROR => EventFilter::Event,
    _ => EventFilter::Ignore,
});

tracing_subscriber::registry()
    .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
    .with(sentry_layer)
    .init();
```

## Logging Messages

Tracing events automatically create breadcrumbs that are attached to the current scope in
Sentry. They show up on errors and transactions captured within this scope as shown in the
examples below.

Fields passed to the event macro are automatically tracked as structured data in Sentry. For
breadcrumbs, they are shown directly with the breadcrumb message. For other types of data, read
below.

```rust
for i in 0..10 {
    tracing::debug!(number = i, "Generates a breadcrumb");
}
```

## Tracking Errors

The easiest way to emit errors is by logging an event with `ERROR` level. This will create a
grouped issue in Sentry. To add custom information, prepend the message with fields. It is also
possible to add Sentry tags if a field is prefixed with `"tags."`

```rust
tracing::error!(
    field = "value",                  // will become a context field
    tags.custom = "value",            // will become a tag in Sentry
    "this is an error with a custom tag",
);
```

To track [error structs](https://docs.rs/sentry-tracing/0.32.0/sentry_tracing/std::error::Error), assign a reference to error trait object as field
in one of the logging macros. By convention, it is recommended to use the `ERROR` level and
assign it to a field called `error`, although the integration will also work with all other
levels and field names.

All other fields passed to the macro are captured in a custom "Tracing Fields" context in
Sentry.

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use std::io;

let custom_error = io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "oh no");
tracing::error!(error = &custom_error as &dyn Error);
```

It is also possible to combine error messages with error structs. In Sentry, this creates issues
grouped by the message and location of the error log, and adds the passed error as nested
source.

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use std::io;

let custom_error = io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "oh no");
tracing::error!(error = &custom_error as &dyn Error, "my operation failed");
```

## Tracing Spans

The integration automatically tracks `tracing` spans as spans in Sentry. A convenient way to do
this is with the `#[instrument]` attribute macro, which creates a transaction for the function
in Sentry.

Function arguments are added as context fields automatically, which can be configured through
attribute arguments. Refer to documentation of the macro for more information.

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

// Functions instrumented by tracing automatically report
// their span as transactions.
#[tracing::instrument]
async fn outer() {
    for i in 0..10 {
        inner(i).await;
    }
}

// This creates spans inside the outer transaction, unless called directly.
#[tracing::instrument]
async fn inner(i: u32) {
    // Also works, since log events are ingested by the tracing system
    tracing::debug!(number = i, "Generates a breadcrumb");

    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
}
```
