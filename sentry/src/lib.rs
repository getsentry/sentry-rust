//! This crate provides support for logging events and errors / panics to the
//! [Sentry] error logging service. It integrates with the standard panic
//! system in Rust as well as a few popular error handling setups.
//!
//! [Sentry]: https://sentry.io/
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! The most convenient way to use this library is via the [`sentry::init`] function,
//! which starts a sentry client with a default set of integrations, and binds
//! it to the current [`Hub`].
//!
//! The [`sentry::init`] function returns a guard that when dropped will flush Events that were not
//! yet sent to the sentry service. It has a two second deadline for this so shutdown of
//! applications might slightly delay as a result of this. Keep the guard around or sending events
//! will not work.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let _guard = sentry::init("https://key@sentry.io/42");
//! sentry::capture_message("Hello World!", sentry::Level::Info);
//! // when the guard goes out of scope here, the client will wait up to two
//! // seconds to send remaining events to the service.
//! ```
//!
//! More complex examples on how to use sentry can also be found in [examples]. Extended instructions
//! may also be found on [Sentry itself].

//!
//! # Integrations
//!
//! What makes this crate useful are its various integrations. Some of them are enabled by
//! default; See [Features]. Uncommon integrations or integrations for deprecated parts of
//! the ecosystem require a feature flag. For available integrations and how to use them, see
//! [integrations] and [apply_defaults].
//!
//! [Features]: #features
//! [integrations]: integrations/index.html
//! [apply_defaults]: fn.apply_defaults.html
//!
//! # Minimal API
//!
//! This crate comes fully-featured. If the goal is to instrument libraries for usage
//! with sentry, or to extend sentry with a custom [`Integration`] or a [`Transport`],
//! one should use the [`sentry-core`] crate instead.

//! # Features
//!
//! Additional functionality and integrations are enabled via feature flags. Some features require
//! extra setup to function properly.

//!
//! ## Logging
//! - `log`: Enables support for the `log` crate.
//! - `slog`: Enables support for the `slog` crate.
//! - `debug-logs`: **Deprecated**. Uses the `log` crate for internal logging.
//!

/// Available Sentry Integrations.
///
/// Integrations extend the functionality of the SDK for some common frameworks and
/// libraries. There are two different kinds of integrations:
/// - Event sources
/// - Event processors
///
/// Integrations which are **event sources** such as
/// [`sentry::integrations::anyhow`] typically provide one or more functions to
/// create new events. These integrations will have an extension trait which exposes
/// a new method on the [`Hub`].
///
/// Integrations which **process events** in some way usually implement the
/// [`Integration`] trait and need to be installed when sentry is initialised.
///
/// # Installing Integrations
///
/// Processing integrations which implement [`Integration`] need to be installed
/// when sentry is initialised. This can be accomplished by using
/// [`ClientOptions::add_integration()`].
///
/// For example, if one were to disable the default integrations (see below) but
/// still wanted to use [`sentry::integrations::debug_images`]:
///
/// ```
/// # #[cfg(feature = "debug-images")] {
/// use sentry::ClientOptions;
/// use sentry::integrations::debug_images::DebugImagesIntegration;
///
/// let options = ClientOptions {
///     default_integrations: false,
///     ..Default::default()
/// }.add_integration(DebugImagesIntegration::new());
/// let _guard = sentry::init(options);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Default Integrations
///
/// The [`ClientOptions::default_integrations`] option is a boolean field that
/// when enabled will enable all of the default integrations via
/// [`apply_defaults()`] **before** any integrations provided by
/// [`ClientOptions::integrations`] are installed. Those interested in a list
/// of default integrations and how they are applied are advised to visit
/// [`apply_defaults()`]'s implementation.
