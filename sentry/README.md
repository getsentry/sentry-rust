# Sentry Rust SDK: sentry

This crate provides support for logging events and errors / panics to the
[Sentry] error logging service. It integrates with the standard panic
system in Rust as well as a few popular error handling setups.

[Sentry]: https://sentry.io/

## Quickstart

The most convenient way to use this library is via the [`sentry::init`] function,
which starts a sentry client with a default set of integrations, and binds
it to the current [`Hub`]. More Information on how to use Sentry in parallel,
concurrent and async scenarios can be found on the [`Hub`] docs as well.

The [`sentry::init`] function returns a guard that when dropped will flush Events that were not
yet sent to the sentry service. It has a two second deadline for this so shutdown of
applications might slightly delay as a result of this. Keep the guard around or sending events
will not work.

```rust
let _guard = sentry::init("https://key@sentry.io/42");
sentry::capture_message("Hello World!", sentry::Level::Info);
// when the guard goes out of scope here, the client will wait up to two
// seconds to send remaining events to the service.
```

More complex examples on how to use sentry can also be found in [examples]. Extended instructions
may also be found on [Sentry itself].

## Integrations

What makes this crate useful are its various integrations. Some of them are enabled by
default; See [Features]. Uncommon integrations or integrations for deprecated parts of
the ecosystem require a feature flag. For available integrations and how to use them, see
[integrations] and [apply_defaults].

[apply_defaults]: https://docs.rs/sentry/0.32.0/sentry/fn.apply_defaults.html

## Minimal API

This crate comes fully-featured. If the goal is to instrument libraries for usage
with sentry, or to extend sentry with a custom [`Integration`] or a [`Transport`],
one should use the [`sentry-core`] crate instead.

[`Integration`]: https://docs.rs/sentry/0.32.0/sentry/trait.Integration.html
[`Transport`]: https://docs.rs/sentry/0.32.0/sentry/trait.Transport.html

## Features

Additional functionality and integrations are enabled via feature flags. Some features require
extra setup to function properly.
