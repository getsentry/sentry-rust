# Changelog

## Unreleased

**Breaking Changes**:

- Bump the minimum required Rust version to **1.42.0**.
- The `actix` integration / middleware is now compatible with `actix-web 3`.
- Removed all deprecated exports and deprecated feature flags.
- The `failure` integration / feature is now off-by-default along with its deprecation.
- The `log` and `slog` integrations were re-designed, they now offer types that wrap a `log::Log` or `slog::Drain` and forward log events to the currently active sentry `Hub` based on an optional filter and an optional mapper.
- The new `log` integration will not implicitly call `log::set_max_level_filter` anymore, and users need to do so manually.

**Deprecations**:

- The `error-chain` and `failure` integration was officially deprecated and will be removed soon.

## 0.20.1

**Fixes**:

- Fixed a deadlock when nesting `configure_scope` calls.
- Improved transport shutdown logic and fixed a potential deadlock on shutdown.

## 0.20.0

**Highlights**:

- The Rust SDK now has **experimental** support for [Release Health Sessions](https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases/health/) using the `start_session` and `end_session` API (global and on the `Hub`).

**Breaking Changes**:

- The `Transport` was changed to work on `Envelope`s instead of `Event`s. The `send_event` trait function was removed in favor of `send_envelope`.

**Features**:

- The `Envelope`, `SessionUpdate`, and other related types have been added to the `sentry_types::protocol::v7` module.
- A `clear_breadcrumbs` method was added to `Scope`.
- `sentry_contexts::utils` is now public.

**Fixes**:

- Panic events now have a proper `mechanism`.

**Deprecations**:

- The `Future` and `FutureExt` exports have been renamed to `SentryFuture` and `SentryFutureExt` respectively.

## 0.19.1

**Fixes**:

- Better deal with concurrent Hub access.

## 0.19.0

**Highlights**:

The `sentry` crate has been split up into a `sentry-core`, and many smaller per-integration crates. Application users should continue using the `sentry` crate, but library users and integration/transport authors are encouraged to use the `sentry-core` crate instead.

Additionally, sentry can now be extended via `Integration`s.

**Breaking Changes**:

- The `utils` module has been removed, and most utils have been moved into integrations.
- The `integrations` module was completely rewritten.
- When constructing a `Client` using a `ClientOptions` struct manually, it does not have any default integrations, and it does not resolve default options from environment variables any more. Please use the explicit `apply_defaults` function instead. The `init` function will automatically call `apply_defaults`.
- The `init` function canâ€™t be called with a `Client` anymore.

**Features**:

- Sentry can now capture `std::error::Error` types, using the `capture_error` and `Hub::capture_error` functions, and an additional `event_from_error` utility function.
- Sentry now has built-in support to bind a `Hub` to a `Future`.
- Sentry can now be extended with `Integration`s.
- The `ClientInitGuard`, `Future` and `ScopeGuard` structs and `apply_defaults`, `capture_error`, `event_from_error`, `with_integration` and `parse_type_from_debug` functions have been added to the root exports.
- The `FutureExt`, `Integration`, `IntoBreadcrumbs`, `IntoDsn`, `Transport` and `TransportFactory` traits are now exported.
- The `types` module now re-exports `sentry-types`.

**Deprecations**:

- The `internals` module is deprecated. Please `use` items from the crate root or the `types` module instead.
- All the feature flags have been renamed, the old names are still available but will be removed in the future.
