# Changelog

## 0.19.0

**Highlights**:

The `sentry` crate has been split up into a `sentry-core`, and many smaller per-integration crates. Application users should continue using the `sentry` crate, but library users and integration/transport authors are encouraged to use the `sentry-core` crate instead.

Additionally, sentry can now be extended via `Integration`s.

**Breaking Changes**:

- The `utils` module has been removed, and most utils have been moved into integrations.
- The `integrations` module was completely rewritten.
- When constructing a `Client` using a `ClientOptions` struct manually, it does not have any default integrations, and it does not resolve default options from environment variables any more. Please use the explicit `apply_defaults` function instead. The `init` function will automatically call `apply_defaults`.
- The `init` function canâ€™t be called with a `Client` anymore.

**Features**:

- Sentry can now capture `std::error::Error` types, using the `capture_error` and `Hub::capture_error` functions, and an additional `event_from_error` utility function.
- Sentry now has built-in support to bind a `Hub` to a `Future`.
- Sentry can now be extended with `Integration`s.
- The `ClientInitGuard`, `Future` and `ScopeGuard` structs and `apply_defaults`, `capture_error`, `event_from_error`, `with_integration` and `parse_type_from_debug` functions have been added to the root exports.
- The `FutureExt`, `Integration`, `IntoBreadcrumbs`, `IntoDsn`, `Transport` and `TransportFactory` traits are now exported.
- The `types` module now re-exports `sentry-types`.

**Deprecations**:

- The `internals` module is deprecated. Please `use` items from the crate root or the `types` module instead.
- All the feature flags have been renamed, the old names are still available but
