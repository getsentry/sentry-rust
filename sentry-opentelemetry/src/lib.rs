//! OpenTelemetry support for Sentry.
//!
//! This integration allows you to capture spans from your existing OpenTelemetry setup and send
//! them to Sentry, with support for distributed tracing.
//!
//! It's assumed that only the [OpenTelemetry tracing
//! API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/) is used to start/end/modify Spans.
//! Mixing it with the Sentry tracing API (e.g. `sentry_core::start_transaction(ctx)`) will not
//! work, as the spans created with the two methods will not be nested properly.
//!
//! Capturing events with `sentry::capture_event` will send them to Sentry with the correct
//! trace and span association.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! Add the necessary dependencies to your Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! opentelemetry = { version = "0.29.1", features = ["trace"] }
//! opentelemetry_sdk = { version = "0.29.0", features = ["trace"] }
//! sentry = { version = "0.38.0", features = ["opentelemetry"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Initialize Sentry with a `traces_sample_rate`, then register the [`SentryPropagator`] and the
//! [`SentrySpanProcessor`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use opentelemetry::{
//!     global,
//!     trace::{TraceContextExt, Tracer},
//!     KeyValue,
//! };
//! use opentelemetry_sdk::trace::SdkTracerProvider;
//! use sentry::integrations::opentelemetry as sentry_opentelemetry;
//!
//! // Initialize the Sentry SDK
//! let _guard = sentry::init((
//!     "https://your-dsn@sentry.io/0",
//!     sentry::ClientOptions {
//!         // Enable capturing of traces; set this a to lower value in production.
//!         // For more sophisticated behavior use a custom
//!         // [`sentry::ClientOptions::traces_sampler`] instead.
//!         // That's the equivalent of a tail sampling processor in OpenTelemetry.
//!         // These options will only affect sampling of the spans that are sent to Sentry,
//!         // not of the underlying OpenTelemetry spans.
//!         traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
//!         debug: true,
//!         ..sentry::ClientOptions::default()
//!     },
//! ));
//!
//! // Register the Sentry propagator to enable distributed tracing
//! global::set_text_map_propagator(sentry_opentelemetry::SentryPropagator::new());
//!
//! let tracer_provider = SdkTracerProvider::builder()
//!     // Register the Sentry span processor to send OpenTelemetry spans to Sentry
//!     .with_span_processor(sentry_opentelemetry::SentrySpanProcessor::new())
//!     .build();
//!
//! global::set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider);
//! ```
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Use the OpenTelemetry API to create spans. They will be captured by Sentry:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let tracer = global::tracer("tracer");
//! // Creates a Sentry span (transaction) with the name set to "example"
//! tracer.in_span("example", |_| {
//!     // Creates a Sentry child span with the name set to "child"
//!     tracer.in_span("child", |cx| {
//!         // OTEL span attributes are captured as data attributes on the Sentry span
//!         cx.span().set_attribute(KeyValue::new("my", "attribute"));
//!
//!         // Captures a Sentry error message and associates it with the ongoing child span
//!         sentry::capture_message("Everything is on fire!", sentry::Level::Error);
//!     });
//! });
//! ```
