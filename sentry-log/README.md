# Sentry Rust SDK: sentry-log

Adds support for automatic Breadcrumb and Event capturing from logs.

The `log` crate is supported in two ways. First, logs can be captured as
breadcrumbs for later. Secondly, error logs can be captured as events to
Sentry. By default anything above `Info` is recorded as breadcrumb and
anything above `Error` is captured as error event.

## Examples

```rust
let mut log_builder = pretty_env_logger::formatted_builder();
log_builder.parse_filters("info");
let logger = sentry_log::SentryLogger::with_dest(log_builder.build());

log::set_boxed_logger(Box::new(logger)).unwrap();
log::set_max_level(log::LevelFilter::Info);

let _sentry = sentry::init(());

log::info!("Generates a breadcrumb");
log::error!("Generates an event");
```

Or one might also set an explicit filter, to customize how to treat log
records:

```rust
use sentry_log::LogFilter;

let logger = sentry_log::SentryLogger::new().filter(|md| match md.level() {
    log::Level::Error => LogFilter::Event,
    _ => LogFilter::Ignore,
});
```
